lice,integumentary,"mane and tail rubbing, flank biting, patches of hair loss, tiny wingless insects visible in hair coat, poor quality hair coat, weight loss","lice are rather common in horses, especially in sick, old or otherwise debilitated animals. these horses will often have a longer hair coat and patchy areas of hair loss with scaly skin. they will also demonstrate varying degrees of itchiness, ranging from non-existent to severe. horses will most often be affected on the neck, shoulders, mane, tail, or, less often, the legs. there are two species of lice which affect horses--the biting (datmalinia equi, mallophaga), and the sucking (hematopinus asini, anoplura) louse. it is useful to identify the species of lice prior to treatment, because the treatment is different between the two species of lice. hematopinus asini lice are a bit bigger than datmalinia equi and are easier to see on the horse. there are usually higher numbers present on the horse, concentrating in the mane, base of tail, fetlocks, and upper and inner thighs. horses with longer hair coats tend to harbor higher numbers of lice. clipping the horse's coat after the lice have already infested may help reduce the number of lice but isn't an effective method of treatment to rid the horse of them completely. in order to confirm whether the horse has lice, a visual check of the hair coat can be done. it is best to perform the examination after the horse has been exercised, as when the horse sweats the lice will climb out towards the tip of the hairs. tools needed include mineral oil, a magnifying glass, ear forceps, and a flea-comb. applying a small amount of mineral oil on the flea-comb, then combing through the hair coat, will cause the lice to stick to the flea-comb. transmission lice are easily spread by close contact with other horses, or from sharing brushes or tack.",https://horsedvm.com/disease/lice
lightning strikes,accidents,"found dead in the pasture after a storm, abnormal behavior, appears to be blind, mouth twitching, ataxia, bleeding from the nose, unable to stand","horses are at risk of getting struck by lightning when they are outside in the pasture during thunderstorms. hundreds of livestock are killed annually by lightning worldwide, with many incidents never reported. the degree of risk is dependent on:the lightning flash or stroke density of the geographical areatopographical landscapecharacteristics and distribution of trees (height, size, species, location relative to other trees, ground root system)habits of animals during stormsgeographical area horses living in regions with high flash or stroke densities are more likely to get struck by lightning then those that aren't. in the united states, these areas predominately include the southeast (especially florida), gulf states, the mississippi and ohio river valleys, the front range of the rocky mountains, and some other mountains in the desert southwest. layout of the pasture lightning is caused by an imbalance of positive and negative charges in the atmosphere. during a storm, negative charges are generated along the bottoms of clouds. positive charges are generated on buildings, trees, or any objects that protrude upwards from ground level. as both these charges increase, once they reach high enough levels, it causes a streamer of negative charges to move erratically in the direction of the earth. at the same time, a short leader of positive charges may move a short distance upwards into the air. once the two charges meet, the negatively charged streamer from the clouds completes its grounding path as the positive charges move upwards along the same path, and into the clouds. any trees, buildings, or other objects that are tall and isolated, tend to generate more positive charges. therefore, pastures that are hilly, contain isolated tall trees, buildings or other objects, are more at risk of getting struck by lightning. trees the taller and more isolated the tree, the more it's at risk of getting struck by lightning. also, certain trees are more susceptible to lightning strikes than others. these trees should be identified and either protected or removed from pastures where horses are turned out into. susceptibility of non-protected temperate zone trees to lightning strikessource: t smiley, 2011 animal habits during thunderstorms the most common ways horses die from lightning strikes are not actually through a direct hit (direct strikes), but through indirect hits, which include:ground current: ground current strikes occur when lightning hits the ground, causing the current (often 20,000+ amperes worth) to spread out along soil surface, including any obstacles (such as horses) that may be in the vicinity. for a horse standing on the ground affected by the current, it can travel up a hind legs, through their entire body and down the front legs. along the way, it can potentially stop the horse's heart or arrest it's breathing. the greater the space between where the current enters the horse's body and where it leaves, the greater the potential for serious damage.side flash: side flash occurs because lightning follows the path with the least resistance to electrical current to the ground. if a horse is standing underneath a tree that is struck by lightning, the lightning is more likely to jump from the tree to the horse. so one lightning strike to a tree or a strike to the ground can jump back and forth among all the animals nearby.contact strike: occurs when a horse is touching an object that is in the pathway of the lightning current, such as if it hits a water trough or electric fence.summary of reported horse deaths caused by lightning strikes",https://horsedvm.com/disease/lightning-strikes
