    "document": "Disease Name: equine pythiosis\nCategory: infectious\nSymptoms: lesions along the limbs or ventral abdomen, may look like summer sores, itchiness\nDescription: equine pythiosis, also known as swamp cancer, is a potentially fatal disease seen most commonly in horses living in tropical or subtropical climates. it is caused by direct contact with a water source containing pythium insidiosum, a type of waterborne fungal parasite. pythiosis is frequently seen in horses, as well as dogs and to a lesser extent cats and humans, living in swampy areas of the southeastern united states, hence where the disease got the nickname, “swamp cancer”. equine pythiosis can occur in three different forms in horses: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and rhinofacial. the cutaneous form of the disease is generally associated with the onset of large, ulcerative, proliferative, pyogranulomatous lesions affecting the outer layers of the skin. the lesions are most commonly found along the horse's legs, belly, and face---areas which are most likely to have had direct contact with the water source. cutaneous pythiosis generally starts out as a minor wound which doesn't heal, progressing to the formation of granulation tissue and necrotic cells, which turn into yellow to gray crater or coral-like structures (referred to as kunkers). where p. insidiosum is found p. insidiosum is an opportunistic pathogen that lives in warm stagnant water and usually most abundant during the rainy season. most cases of equine pythiosis have been associated with exposure to swamps or marshes in horse pastures, especially if flooding or overflow of water occurs. how equine pythiosis is diagnosed equine pythiosis is diagnosed by the detection of morphological features of the organism on cytologic and/or histopathologic examinations. treatment options for equine pythiosis treatment involves debridement of the lesion, wound management, topical dressing application, administering an equine pythiosis immunotherapy vaccine. treatment of horses with pythiosis is most effective if the condition is diagnosed and therapy begins within 15 days of infection. despite the fungal-like attributes of p. insidiosum, anti-fungal medications are not an effective treatment option.",

(h. gingivalis) has been reported to infect horses and humans. it is found in decaying organic matter, horse manure, and soil. little is known about how horses become infected with h. gingivalis or its life cycle. the method of how it enters the horse is thought to be related to penetration of the mucous membranes, particularly oropharyngeal and skin wounds. once inside the horse, h. gingivalis migrates to different organs in the horse's body, where it reproduces. once clinical signs of cns involvement develop, the disease is rapidly fatal. historical cases of infected horses 2001: a 12-year-old arabian gelding was treated with ivermectin (1.2 mg/kg [0.55 mg/lb] of body weight, po, every 2 weeks for 3 treatments). the granuloma was surgically debulked 2 days after the first dose of ivermectin. the granuloma resolved with no evidence of nematode infection after 18 months. 2012: two icelandic stallions died of the disease. one stallion sustained injuries to the mouth after an accident, developed severe neurological signs and had to be euthanatized. histological examination revealed mild inflammation and malacia in the cerebellum associated with the presence of numerous h. gingivalis nematodes. the second stallion started swerving to one side and lost balance was euthanatized due to lack of response to therapy and rapid deterioration. histological examination revealed numerous h. gingivalis nematodes in the cerebellum, brain stem, cervical spinal cord and in the meninges, with minimal reactive changes. 2013: a 13-week-old thoroughbred colt from central kentucky was euthanized after an acute onset of ataxia, blindness, head tremors, leaning to the right, recumbency, and seizures. microscopically, there was a verminous meningoencephalitis characterized by an eosinophilic and granulomatous inflammatory reaction primarily affecting the cerebellum. dispersed within regions of inflammation were numerous cross and longitudinal sections of intact and degenerative small nematodes. the nematodes had dorsoflexed ovaries and ventroflexed vulvas, which are distinguishing features of halicephalobus gingivalis. intact nematodes, compatible with h. gingivalis, also were recovered and identified from portions of the brain that had been frozen for 5-week post-necropsy examination via tissue maceration and additional laboratory techniques. 2014: a 6-year-old thoroughbred gelding in korea was euthanized after a 2-month period of abnormal neurological signs, such as circling left in his pen and hitting his head and body against the wall. after the horse was euthanized on the farm, a half of the brain and whole blood were submitted for diagnostic tests. histopathological examination of the brain revealed granulomatous and eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with numerous intralesional nematodes, predominantly affecting the cerebrum. multifocal malacic foci were scattered in the brain parenchyma. the intralesional parasites were identified as h. gingivalis by morphological features and pcr testing. 2016: two lipizzaner stallions living at two different breeding farms in romania died from the disease. at necropsy, granulomatous and necrotizing lesions were observed in the kidneys, lymph nodes, brain, retroperitoneal adipose tissue, and lungs, indicating a systemic infection. parasitological and histopathological analyses evidenced larval and adult forms of rhabditiform nematodes consistent with halicephalobus species. 2017: a 13-year-old koninklijk warmbloed paard nederland stallion in piedmont, italy died. the post-mortem examination revealed neuropathological findings consisted of granulomatous meningoencephalitis and larvae and adult females of h. gingivalis were isolated and identified from the digested brain. two unrelated horses living in southern california were diagnosed with halicephalobiasis in july 2017. case 1: an 18-year-old gypsy vanner mare who had been experiencing progressive neurological signs which included:day 1: ataxia and head pressingday 2: recumbencyday 3: dog paddlingthe horse was euthanized on day 3. the necropsy results revealed no gross lesions. the histopathologic examination of the horse's brain and spinal cord showed the presence of multifocal granulomatous meningoencephalitis and neuritis of cranial and spinal nerves, with abundant intralesional nematodes and eggs.case 2: an arabian mare presented with a history of chronic, severe hematuria (presence of blood in the urine) and deterioration. the horse was euthanized. the field necropsy performed by the veterinarian revealed large, firm, off-white nodular masses in both of the horse's kidneys, and scattered small firm to gritty nodules in the lungs. the histologic exam revealed the kidney masses were exuberant granulation tissue and inflammation with large numbers of intralesional nematodes, larvae, and egg. the lung nodules consisted of smaller granulomas with nematodes.",

muscle biopsies must be taken, prepared, and shipped in accordance with specific instructions provided by the equine neuromuscular diagnostic laboratory (nmdl), a diagnostic laboratory located at michigan state university in the united states. once the nmdl receives the samples to be biopsied, the samples are processed once per week and read out within 10 days unless an expedited request is made.genetic testing - performed on whole blood samples or hair roots of suspected horses, which are submitted to the university of minnesota veterinary diagnostic laboratory for a specific genetic test available.rehab care for pssm1 horses following a tying up episode if a horse has just experienced an acute tying up episode, reintroduction of exercise should be made very slowly consisting of light, slow uncollected work on a longe-line or under saddle beginning with once a day for 3-5 minutes at a walk and trot. exercise should not start until 2 weeks after appropriate diet modifications are made. once exercise has started, it needs to be done on a consistent basis, with minimal days without some form of exercise is given. exercise duration is the most important aspect, rather than intensity of exercise. this initial work should be very mild and very short in duration. work at a walk and trot can be gradually increased by two minutes each day. when the horse can exercise for 15 minutes, a five-minute break at a walk can be provided, and then a few intervals of walk and trot can gradually be increased. at least three weeks of walk and trot should precede work at a canter. long-term management of horses with pssm1 horses diagnosed with pssm1 require some lifestyle changes in order to help manage their condition and prevent tying-up episodes from occurring. these changes are related to diet, management (turnout), and exercise---each being equally important for horses with pssm1. diet: switch to a low starch/sugar diet initially before adding fat, which should be introduced gradually, over several weeks. suitable oils include soybean, corn, safflower, canola, flaxseed, linseed, fish, peanut and coconut. the amount of oil can be added gradually monitoring the horses exercise tolerance and weight. the amount added is usually between 1/2 and 2 cups. if horses don't like the oil, rice bran (15-20%) can also be used as a substitute. however, if rice bran is added then other dietary modifications will need to be made to ensure that the horse's calcium: phosphorus ratio is adequate, since rice bran contains excessive phosphorus levels relative to calcium. once adjusted, switch horses to a, low starch high fat diet.management: horses with pssm1 should be turnout as much as possible, ideally 24/7 with other horses in a low stress environment. exercise: daily exercise is an extremely important aspect for managing horses with pssm1. even 10 min of exercise has been shown to be extremely beneficial in reducing muscle damage with exercise. once conditioned, some pssm1 horses thrive with 4 days of exercise as long as they receive daily turn out. for riding horses with type 2 pssm1, a prolonged warm-up with adequate stretching is recommended. rest periods that allow horses to relax and stretch their muscles between 2 – 5 min periods of collection under saddle may be of benefit.",
